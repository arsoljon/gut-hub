-What Is the Microbiome?
The human gut is home to a variety of microbes, including bacteria, archaea (single-celled organisms without nuclei that are related more closely to eukaryotes than to bacteria), fungi (mostly yeasts), microbial eukaryotes (usually Blastocystis in the United States, but a variety of pathogenic and nonpathogenic taxa in developing countries), and viruses/phages. This collection of microbes is called the microbiota; their genes are called the microbiome.
-Therefore, there is no standard microbiome ecology that all healthy people share. 
-On the other hand, changes induced by diet (eg, those associated with weight loss), take place on a timescale closer to months than days in human beings.
