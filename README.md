# gut-hub
What does your personal gut profile look like? How do the foods you eat affect your gut? Lets visualize it all using gut-hub

## Feature Ideas
- Create a general gut outline. 
- Pick certain vitamins and colorize them. Then create a color rainbow or blend based off the quantity of different vitamins you receive from foods.
- The gut is mapped as being the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and rectum. Find studies about each. 

Questions: 

* What kind of bacteria does your food breakdown into?
* How does bacteria breakdown nutrients in your gut?
* Focusing on popular foods for gut health, (ie. kimchi, sauerkraut, yogurt, kombucha) what facilitates "good" gut health from each?
* Can gut health be graded based off quality of poop?
* Is gut health influenced by hormones? Or does gut health influence hormone production?
* Is the waste product of a microbiome the benefit? / Or is it the process of eliminating certain nutrients? / (purfication)
* Depending on where the microbe is located in the map of the gut, do they benefit or harm differently?

* What Is the Microbiome?
The human gut is home to a variety of microbes, including bacteria, archaea (single-celled organisms without nuclei that are related more closely to eukaryotes than to bacteria), fungi (mostly yeasts), microbial eukaryotes (usually Blastocystis in the United States, but a variety of pathogenic and nonpathogenic taxa in developing countries), and viruses/phages. This collection of microbes is called the microbiota; their genes are called the microbiome.

* Therefore, there is no standard microbiome ecology that all healthy people share. 

* On the other hand, changes induced by diet (eg, those associated with weight loss), take place on a timescale closer to months than days in human beings.

* We find that despite stable differences between body sites and individuals, there is pronounced variability in an individual's microbiota across months, weeks and even days. Additionally, only a small fraction of the total taxa found within a single body site appear to be present across all time points, suggesting that no core temporal microbiome exists at high abundance (although some microbes may be present but drop below the detection threshold). Many more taxa appear to be persistent but non-permanent community members.

* Role of the human microbiota:
  - (a) it promotes digestion by assisting the absorption of nutrients by gut cells or the fermentation of some food fractions, which generate important metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids.
  - (b) it supports the maturation of the digestive tract by participating in the assembly of gastrointestinal mucus and promoting the enzymatic activity of the mucosa.
  - (c) it performs a barrier function against pathogens and toxins, where some bacteria release antimicrobial agents that protect from the pathogenic bacteria.
  - (d) it plays a protective role in promoting the immune system development.
  - (e) it supports in the synthesis of essential vitamins like vitamin B: Magnúsdóttir et al. estimated that 86% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin B6, 37% of the RDA of vitamin B9, 31% of the RDA of vitamin B12, and 27% of the RDA of vitamin B3 could be provided by the human gut microbiota.
*  The gut and brain connect via a neuro-immuno-humoral network of signaling pathways known as the gut microbiome–brain axis, which includes the vagus nerve, the immune system, the hormonal system, and bacterial metabolites and products.
* Specific patterns have been reported in plant-based versus animal-based diets.
* The development and modifications of the gut microbiota are influenced by multiple other factors, such as exposure to stress, environmental conditions, medications intake, lifecycle, medical disorders, and procedures.
* The human gut microbiota is divided into many groups called phyla. The gut microbiota primarily comprises four main phyla, including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, with the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes representing 90% of gut microbiota.81,82 The majority of bacteria reside within the gastrointestinal tract, with most predominantly anaerobic bacteria housed in the large intestine.

### Gut-Microbiota-Participant Bacteria
* The human gut microbiome, as mentioned above, is a complex mixture of microorganisms, including viruses, archaea, bacteria, yeasts, and fungi, interacting with each other and with their host in complex ways. These interactions at various times involve symbiosis, mutualism, antagonism, and even predation.
* In healthy human stomach, the genera Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, Rothia, and Haemophilus were found to be predominant; however, the composition of the gastric microbiota is dynamic and affected by such factors as diet, drugs, and diseases.
* The small intestine provides a more challenging environment for microbial colonizers given the short transit times (3–5 h) and the high bile concentrations.
* The large intestine is home to the most complex bacterial diversity...Five major phyla—Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Proteobacteria—covering a wide range of bacterial genera—Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bacteroidetes, Actinomyces, and Propionibacterium—are associated with the large intestine. Other Gram-positive cocci—Micrococci, Peptococci, Peptostreptococci, and Ruminococci—have been also reported to play crucial roles in the large intestine.
* The microbiome composition of the intestinal lumen...is highly diverse and comprises Verrucomicrobia, Fusobacteria, Asteroplasma, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Lentisphaera, Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Bacilli, Clostridia, and Mollicutes. The predominating genera are Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Dorea, Clostridium, Coprococcus, Weisella, and Lactobacillus. Other genera found include Granulicatella, Streptococcus, and Veillonella.

#### Gut Microbiome–Disease Correlations
* Specifically, gut microbes contribute directly and/or indirectly to important physiological activities, including immunomodulation and the regulation of various neurotransmitters, hormones, and metabolites.
* A search in the CAS Content Collection identified a large collection of studies reporting correlations between gut microbiota and a wide range of diseases, including mental, metabolic, and digestive system disorders; cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases; various cancers; and immune and autoimmune diseases
* Dysbiosis is one of the hallmarks in the miscommunication between gut and brain and could lead to IBS symptoms.
*  IBS was typified by enhanced quantities of Firmicutes and specifically in Ruminococcus, Clostridium, and Dorea, along with a distinct decrease of beneficial microbes, such as Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium spp. Moreover, a decrease in probiotic species and an increase in pathogenic species have been reported in patients with IBS, including Proteobacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Bacteroides (Bacteroidetes). Fecal transplantation from super donors and microbiome modulation either by pro- or prebiotics have shown beneficial effect in reducing IBS symptoms and improving patients’ quality of life.
*  Like IBS, inflammatory bowel disease-related dysbiosis is associated with a general decrease in richness, diversity, and stability of the microbiota. This decline in diversity is concomitant with a weakened immune response and setbacks with the cellular barrier functions that normally block bacterial entry from the gut lumen into gut tissue.
*  Gut microbiota communicates with the brain through three major routes: the neural route (vagus nerve, enteric nervous system), the immune route (cytokines), and the endocrine route [hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, gut hormones].
*  Dysbiosis in common intestine microbial species of the phylum Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and the genera Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium are supposedly responsible for mental health disorders. Changes in the levels of gut microbial metabolites have been reported to be associated with neurological conditions like Parkinson’s disease,160 anorexia nervosa,161 Alzheimer’s disease,162 autism spectrum disorders,163 and chronic stress and depression. It is not clear by now, however, whether these disruptions in mental health are the cause or a result of the changes in gut microbiota.
*  The hypothesis that Parkinson’s disease starts in the gut and spreads to the brain169 is gaining increasing support, thereby showing that the disease is associated with widespread dysbiosis.
*  Therapeutic interventions including the administration of pre- and probiotics (psychobiotics) to manage mental disorders and/or their symptoms have been undertaken.174,175 These inventions have included probiotic combinations of lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, which has resulted in a significant drop in psychological distress,176 enhanced cognition and communication among patients with Alzheimer’s disease177 and autism spectrum disorders,178 and recovering symptoms among patients with Parkinson’s disease.
* Systemic metabolic diseases that are believed to be strongly affected by gut microbiota status include obesity and diabetes.
* As a result of a high-fat diet, the intestinal microbiome is modified with rising amounts of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and reduced levels of Bacteroidetes. The Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio has been correlated to body weight, which means it is larger for obese people.185Clostridium difficile infections can also trigger obesity. Generally, obesity is affected by the inflammatory status induced by gut bacteria or their metabolites, which regulate the GBA.

*  Bacteroidetes are the most studied class of gut bacteria with relation to gastrointestinal and mental health, specifically with relation to stress, depression, and anxiety. Bacteroidetes are known to have a very broad metabolic potential and are regarded as one of the most stable parts of gastrointestinal microflora that exhibits remarkable nutritional flexibility and an ability to respond to stress.
*  Firmicutes are the second extensively studied class of gut bacteria with relation to gastrointestinal and mental health, especially in relation to stress and depression.
*  The relationship between Firmicutes and gastrointestinal disorders may be mediated by a number of different factors, such as the production of SCFAs by Firmicutes, which are an important energy source for the gut epithelium and have anti-inflammatory effects.
*  A high-fiber diet can increase the production of SCFAs, which can help to maintain gut barrier function and reduce inflammation. SCFAs can also promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, which can outcompete pathogenic bacteria and reduce inflammation.
*  However, antibiotics can also have negative effects on the gut microbiome, such as by reducing the diversity of gut bacteria and promoting the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Antibiotics should be used judiciously and only when necessary.
*  For example, certain drugs that target the serotonin system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can modulate gut–brain communication and have been shown to be effective in treating conditions, such as depression and anxiety.
#### Gut Microbiota Metabolites
*  The gut microbiota-derived metabolites can be broadly divided into three types according to their origination: (1) metabolites that are produced by gut microbiota directly from diets; (2) metabolites that are generated by the host and modified by gut microbiota; (3) metabolites that are produced de novo
